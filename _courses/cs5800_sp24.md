<!-- Homework -->
{% capture homework %}
There are 6 individual homework assignments. Due dates will be posted with the homework. Late submissions will not be accepted. Please let me know 72 hours in advance before the due date if you need extensions with a reasonable justification.

Requests for regrades in writing will only be accepted no less than 10 days after receiving the grade. Please send the instructor your NUID and name with the title “Request for regrade: HW#” via email. The new grade may be lower than the original one.

Please feel free to refer to any materials from my slides. You may discuss homework with your classmates, but all the assignments are supposed to be completed on your own. Sharing of completed solutions will not be tolerated. Plagiarism will be considered if solutions and project documentations have a very high degree of similarity with other students’ work or materials online. Such academic dishonesty will be handled in accordance with university policies.

<!-- Projects -->
{% capture wecare %}
Eating healthy food, having regular exercise, avoiding alcohol and drugs, getting adequate sleep, and taking time to relax will help you achieve your goals and manage stress.

If you have difficulty keeping up with any materials or homework for personal reasons, please let me know early. If you or your friends/classmates appear to be struggling or having trouble coping with stress, we strongly encourage you to seek support at the [We Care](https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/we-care/){:target="_blank"} program at NEU. At Northeastern, a student is never alone when struggling with a demanding situation.
